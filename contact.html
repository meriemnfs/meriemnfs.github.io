        <p>
            Feel free to send me a message if you want to propose me a deal, I'm up to be paid in sushi if it's worth it! Let me know if you
            want to know anything, I'm up for hearing about cool projects, inspirational ideas, anything, try me. I've always thought that 
            the contact pages are always soooo boring, even when it's about crazy people, so let's make it at least funnier.
