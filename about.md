# A little bit of me


Half german and half moroccan currently living in Norway. I got my first reflex camera in college, eating rice for months to save money for it. Lover of landscapes and new places to discover, and eternal seeker of light. I've discovered the beauty in the people through portraits and cannot stop since I've begun.
